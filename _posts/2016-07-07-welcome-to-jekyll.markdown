What's Up Everyone?! My name is Rajiv Ramaiah and Rajiv is my first name and Ramaiah is my last name, if you weren't aware of the conventions of a person's name. It's okay, it happens to the best of us. I am currently writing this from the crappy, bug-filled building that is Lord, in room 202. Some say these living conditions might build character... Actually... That's probably true lol. I had a crazy FIFA match with my friend today for 10$ though. I was Barca and he was Real Madrid - the stage has been set. Out of nowhere, he scored 3 goals in the first ten minutes and I was definitely rattled. A hat trick by Ronaldo at that stage of a match would leave any experienced FIFA player rattled, let alone me who completely sucks at the game but my belief that I am god at the game has led me to an almost 50-50 Win Loss ratio. Well, after those three goals I went off. I was up 4-3 by the half, and extended my lead to win by two goals for a final score of 7-5. Yah, we both suck, but the adrenaline rush was amazing. Too bad Messi got sentenced to like 21 months in jail. What a shame... Anyways, I'll be back at it tomorrow, until then. Rajiv :P
